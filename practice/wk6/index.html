				My name is Gerald Fangonillo and I was born on the 7th of September, 1989 in Philippines. My passion to technology leads me to this porgram, Computer Systems Technology. Since I was a kid, I love to experiment stuffs until it breaks and satisfy myself with troubles trying to fix it. I built my first personal computer when I was 10, unfortunately Internet was not so popular yet during that time.
			<p>	
				During my childhood, I never had the chance to spend time with my parents since they were working outside the country. Therefore I missed the fun of dad and son relationship. I grew up with my grandmother's care me and I'm proud to say despite all the facts about it, unlike most other kids I didn't grew up with nasty attitude.
			</p>	
				New adventures started when I went to high school. I met people with different characters and luckily I didn't fall off to the wrong party. For four years I really enjoyed my time in high school and I would love to travel back anytime.
			<p>	
				I came to Canada almost two years now. My first year experiences gave me one of the worst thing ever happened to my entire life. Not even thousand words would be enough to describe how bad it is. Well, can't do anything but to deal with the facts. I decided to start anew this year and I'm so glad when got admitted to George Brown. So far, things going down pretty well. Have some worries on the financing part but somehow I will manage. 
			</p>	
				This is just a slice of my whole story, I'm an easy going type of person so don't hesitate to approach me anytime. Just be who you are and we will get along for sure.
