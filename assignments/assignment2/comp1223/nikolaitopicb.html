                    <li>Predicated on what the Soviets have done with Sputnik, sending it into space, which made Americans think of technology and science in a very serious manner</li>
                    <li>The U.S. accelerated their science programs, which eventually led to MIT conceptualize this idea of packet switching and how to do communications with using packets instead of circuitry</li>
                    <li>In 1966 DARPA developed the ARPANET, publishing this concept in 1967 with the use of packet switching theory, developed specifically for setting up a network topology</li>
                    <li>The first first host-to-host connection was established in latter half of 1960s at University of Utah and UCSB, as this was a historical significance of creating a long distance connection</li>
					<li>The Internet was initially done through circuitry with bits being transmissioned across circuit boards and evolved into entirely something different</li>
                    <li>An open architecture was introduced for separate networks with their own interfaces</li>

				  <h2>Aftermath of the Internet</h2>
                  <p>
					The future of the Internet hinged on how it will be managed, because the architecture of the Internet has to be maintained in some way.
					IP addressing came into play, which is one system that was predominantly used throughout the 1980s.
					It has evolved throughout the decade, introducing such concepts of subnetting and class system of ip addresses.
					Web browsing came about through the form of Mosaic, later to be known as Netscape. From there on then, the Internet only grew
					exponentially, and we have arrived at a point where majority of information we know today are stored online,
					accessed through a device connected to a global network of information. The Internet essentially paved way for global interconnection
					of society.
