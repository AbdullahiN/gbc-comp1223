				Overcoming Math Anxiety<br>
				Square roots, exponents and fractions, oh my! Math is a source of anxiety for many students at all levels of education. Do you suffer from math anxiety? If so, let’s review key strategies that will help you cope.<br><br>				
				<u>Defining Math Anxiety</u><br>
				Math anxiety is comparable to the stage fright many people experience when speaking in front of a large audience. As defined by psychologists, math anxiety occurs when students experience helplessness, mental disorganization and physical stress (such as shortness of breath) while doing math (Tobias and Weissbrod, 1980).<br><i>How can you combat these symptoms to achieve better grades and a healthier state of mind?</i><br><br>
				<u>Remember: You’re not born <strong>‘Bad at Math’</strong></u><br>
				Contrary to popular opinion, aptitude in basic math is not something you’re born with. Research has shown that hard work is the most important factor in improving basic math ability (Dickerson, 2013).Moreover, applied math is the only type of math taught at all George Brown campuses. Like computer algorithms and cooking instructions, applied math is very procedural, meaning that most of its concepts can be mastered with repetitive practice.<br><br>
				<u>Don’t Cram</u><br>
				Regular revision of concepts will improve your confidence and reduce anxiety. Since math is learned with practice, it is critical that you review each day. Ideally, you should complete all homework and assignments whenever they are assigned. When available, additional problems can be useful revision tools for tests. If you’re on a busy schedule, try to spend at least half an hour redoing your in-class problems each day.<br><br><u>Recognize and Manage Symptoms of Anxiety</u><br>
				When experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety, including shortness of breath or stomach cramps, take a few moments to breathe in and out deeply.<br><br>
				<u>Do Easier Problems First</u><br>
				If you come across a challenging problem, skip it and come back to it later. Solve easier problems first to reinforce basic knowledge and to boost confidence. This is a good strategy for test-taking and for combating general math anxiety. If you cannot solve a difficult problem after multiple attempts, seek help from classmates, your teacher or a tutor.<br><br>
				<u>Ask for Help</u><br>
				The key to feeling more comfortable about math is to get help when tackling concepts you find challenging. Professors can pinpoint your areas of strength and weakness and can recommend learning resources best suited to your learning style(s).<br>Tutoring is an excellent resource for those struggling in math. The Tutoring and Learning Centers at all three George Brown campuses provide free one-on-one and group support for all college math courses.<br><br>
				<u>Reward Yourself</u><br>
				Make sure you reward yourself after exams and extended periods of studying. If you genuinely tried your best you should feel satisfied no matter the outcome of your assessment.
Hopefully, these tips will reduce your anxiety, improve your performance in math classes and change your attitude towards math for the better. Best of luck!
